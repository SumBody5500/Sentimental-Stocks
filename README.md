#About the Project:-
As a result of Gen-Z trading habits, emotional trading or FOMO trading has emerged as new found concepts that significantly affect and change the market trends (short or long term) . This model aims to predict how certain news sentiments might affect the market movement of the stocks in question and whether negative or positive news sentiments bear a strong correlation to negative or positive movement in the stock market for the company.
